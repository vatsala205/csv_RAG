Perfect! Let's move on to the **30-page project report presentation** for your RAG system on customer churn analysis.

---

## ✅ Theme for Presentation:

* **Style:** Clean, modern, corporate.
* **Palette:** Use **blue, teal, and white** tones (Canva's “Corporate Clean” or “Professional Pitch Deck” works great).
* **Font Suggestion:** Sans Serif (e.g., Open Sans, Lato).

## 🔥 30-Slide Deck Breakdown (w/ content + design ideas):

### 🧩 Section 1: Introduction (Slides 1–5)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**

* **Title:** “AI-Powered RAG System for Customer Churn Analytics”
* **Subtitle:** “SQL Generation + Natural Language Response on Churn Dataset”
* **Visual:** RAG system diagram or chatbot + database illustration

**Slide 2: Problem Statement**

* Churn is a major issue in telecom businesses.
* Identifying patterns is complex and non-intuitive.
* SQL queries are not accessible to non-technical users.

**Slide 3: Solution Overview**

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with GPT-based SQL synthesis
* Converts user queries to SQL
* Executes on `churn.db`, explains results

**Slide 4: What is RAG?**

* Retrieval: Pulls facts from a structured source (SQLite DB)
* Generation: Summarizes results in natural language
* Visual: Canva flowchart: User → RAG → SQL + NLP → Output

**Slide 5: Dataset Description**

* **Source:** Telco customer churn dataset
* **21 Columns:** Show as grid or Canva table graphic
* Highlight: `Churn`, `Contract`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, etc.

### 💡 Section 2: System Architecture (Slides 6–10)

**Slide 6: Tech Stack**

* Python, Flask, SQLite, OpenAI API, HTML/CSS
* Diagram with logos of each tech

**Slide 7: Project Structure**

* Tree diagram of:

```plaintext
rag_sql_churn/
├── app/
├── templates/
├── data/
├── churn.db
├── main.py
```

**Slide 8: RAG Pipeline**

* Canva flowchart:

  1. User Input →
  2. SQL Generation →
  3. Query Execution →
  4. Result →
  5. Summarized Answer

**Slide 9: Database Setup**

* Data: `churn.csv` → `churn.db`
* Show sample records from CSV
* Mention SQLite conversion via script

**Slide 10: API Workflow**

* `POST /` with question → SQL + Answer
* Diagram showing Flask routing & processing logic

---

### 🧠 Section 3: Key Features (Slides 11–16)

**Slide 11: SQL Query Generation**

* `generate_sql()` using GPT
* Prompted on schema and example queries

**Slide 12: SQL Extraction Logic**

* `extract_sql()` function (regex from LLaMA output)
* Snippet of code

**Slide 13: Safe Query Execution**

* `sqlite3.connect`, `cursor.execute`
* `try/except` for handling query errors

**Slide 14: Result to Dictionary**

* Show transformation to list of dicts
* Important for structured rendering

**Slide 15: Summarization Logic**

* `summarize_response()`: converts rows → sentence
* Uses GPT again to make response readable

**Slide 16: Correction Flow (optional)**

* Can add typo correction via `get_sql_query()`
* If implemented, show before vs. after correction

---

### 🧪 Section 4: Demonstration (Slides 17–21)

**Slide 17: UI Screenshot**

* Canva screenshot mockup: Your web interface

**Slide 18: Query Example #1**

* Input: “How many customers have churned?”
* Show generated SQL + result + answer

**Slide 19: Query Example #2**

* “Average tenure of customers with fiber internet”
* Show SQL + result + answer

**Slide 20: Query Example #3**

* “Top 5 payment methods of churned customers”
* Show SQL + result + answer

**Slide 21: Table Rendering**

* Show how raw SQL result is converted to JSON or UI table

---

### 🚀 Section 5: Benefits & Impact (Slides 22–24)

**Slide 22: Why This Matters**

* Makes data accessible to all roles (not just tech)
* Zero SQL knowledge needed

**Slide 23: Business Impact**

* Enables faster insights into churn
* Example: Targeted retention, better billing strategies

**Slide 24: Scalability**

* Could extend to other domains:

  * HR attrition
  * Finance defaults
  * E-commerce returns

---

### 🛠️ Section 6: Challenges & Learnings (Slides 25–27)

**Slide 25: Challenges**

* Prompt tuning for SQL accuracy
* Handling long/complex questions
* Schema inference in LLM

**Slide 26: Learnings**

* Prompt engineering is key
* Need validation before executing LLM queries

**Slide 27: What Could Be Improved**

* Add user feedback loop
* Add visualization (charts with matplotlib or Plotly)
* Multi-turn conversation support

---

### 📈 Section 7: Future Work + Summary (Slides 28–30)

**Slide 28: Future Scope**

* Add table/chart visualizer
* Voice support (speech-to-text)
* Deploy via Docker or Streamlit Cloud

**Slide 29: Summary**

* 21-feature churn dataset
* Flask + GPT-4 RAG chatbot
* Structured SQL + conversational answers
* Secure, interpretable, accessible insights

**Slide 30: Thank You Slide**

* Add QR code to GitHub repo or demo video (optional)
* Your name, role, contact info
